# 🔐 Web Application Security Assessment – OWASP Juice Shop

This project simulates a real-world **web application penetration test** using the intentionally vulnerable **OWASP Juice Shop**. The goal was to identify and document common security flaws following ethical hacking practices and OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

## 🧪 Project Objective
To conduct a vulnerability assessment on a test web application, identify critical security issues, and provide a professional security report with remediation steps. This hands-on experience replicates tasks performed in cybersecurity roles focused on securing SaaS, startup, and e-commerce platforms.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Burp Suite (Community Edition)** | Intercepting proxy & vulnerability scanning |
| **OWASP Juice Shop** | Test application with known vulnerabilities |
| **Nmap** | Network scanning and port discovery |
| **Dirb** | Directory enumeration |
| **Kali Linux** | Penetration testing environment |
| **Google Docs / Word** | Documentation and reporting |
| **Browser DevTools** | Manual payload injection and inspection |

## 🔍 Vulnerabilities Identified
- Reflected XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)
- Security Misconfiguration (Exposed directories and sensitive files)
- Missing Rate Limiting on Login endpoint

## 📄 Deliverables
